End-to-end machine learning application to assist purchasing a used car

This application has an associated blogpost [here](https://sjhatfield.github.io/Car-purchase-help/)

This is the first end-to-end machine learning powered project I have produced and does not use any fancy models, simply a linear regression. Now that it is completed I will work on more extensive, more intelligent applications.

This application was developed after reading the fantastic book [Building Machine Learning Powered Applications](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/building-machine-learning/9781492045106/) by Emmanuel Ameisen.
